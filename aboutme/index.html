    <p>I am persuing a Software Engineering degree. I love CAD design, 3D printing and electronics projects. I have two 3D printers and spend more time upgrading and modifying them than actually printing with them. The thing I love most about BYUI is the education quality! I would like to set up my own website to showcase my work. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my whole life.</p>
