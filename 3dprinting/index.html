            <p>3D printing is an amazing hobby to get into. The cost of entry is relatively low and you can literally make anything you want! There is some basic knowledge that must be acquired to produce successful prints.There is also a lot of terminology for features and options for 3D printers. This site aims to teach you how to start 3D printing, recommendations for good starter 3D printers, and how to make successful prints.</p>

        <h2 class="headings">How 3D Printing Works</h2>
            <p>Think about a stack of paper, it is an example of a 3D object. 3D printing works by building up a object layer by layer. FDM 3D printing is when a 3D printer extrudes plastic, kind of like a hot glue gun. The motion system of the printer moves the nozzle over the part to print the 3D object. Some objects need supports which are broken off after.</p>

        <p>Extruder: The extruder pushes the plastic to the nozzle using a gear driven by an electric motor.
        </p>
        <p>Heater Block: The heater block is heated electrically to melt the filament or plastic.
        </p>
        <p>Nozzle: The nozzle is screwed into the heater block, it has a small hole, usually 0.4mm that the filament comes out of.
        </p>
        <p>Filament: The plastic the 3D printer uses, it comes in rolls and is typically 1.75mm in diameter. Filament comes in many types and colors. The most common types are PLA, PETG, and TPU. PLA is the easiest to print with, PETG is more difficult but has higher heat resistance, and TPU is hard to print with, but is flexible and very durable. TPU requires a direct drive extruder to print with.</p>
