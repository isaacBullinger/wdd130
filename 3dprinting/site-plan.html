        Introduction:
        3D printing is an amazing hobby to get into. The cost of entry is relatively low and you can literally make anything you want! There is some basic knowledge that must be acquired to produce successful prints. There is also a lot of terminology for features and options for 3D printers. This site aims to teach you how to start 3D printing, recommendations for good starter 3D printers, and how to make successful prints.
        How 3D Printing Works:
        Think about a stack of paper, it is an example of a 3D object. 3D printing works by building up a object layer by layer. FDM 3D printing is when a 3D printer extrudes plastic, kind of like a hot glue gun. The motion system of the printer moves the nozzle over the part to print the 3D object. Some objects need supports which are broken off after.
        3D Printer Terms to Know:
        Extruder:
        The extruder pushes the plastic to the nozzle using a gear driven by an electric motor.
        Heater Block:
        The heater block is heated electrically to melt the filament or plastic.
        Nozzle:
        The nozzle is screwed into the heater block, it has a small hole, usually 0.4mm that the filament comes out of.
        Filament:
        The plastic the 3D printer uses, it comes in rolls and is typically 1.75mm in diameter. Filament comes in many types and colors. The most common types are PLA, PETG, and TPU. PLA is the easiest to print with, PETG is more difficult but has higher heat resistance, and TPU is hard to print with, but is flexible and very durable. TPU requires a direct drive extruder to print with.

      <h3>Get Started</h3>
      <p>
        STL:
        Stereolithography, or STL is the file format for a 3D file. It consists of a physical object made of thousands of triangles. This file must be converted into code that can be interpreted by the printer. The code that sends commands to the printer to make the movements, heat the plastic to the right temperature, extrude the plastic, and run the cooling fans to print the object is called gcode.
        Slicer:
        A slicer is the software that “slices” the STL file into individual layers that the 3D printer prints. Two excellent options are Ultimaker Cura and Prusa’s Slic3r. To slice a file, drag it from your computer into the slicer and click on the slice button. There are many settings you can change in the slicer. The main ones are the infill, support settings, and material temperature.  Infill is the material that fills the part. Supports are printed to support the object because the printer cannot print on thin air. Pictures of infill and supports are shown. Temperature is the temperature the plastic is heated to for melting it. The table below shows the temperatures for the most common materials:

      <h3>Printers</h3>
      <p>
        Creality Ender 3:
        The Creality Ender 3 is around $200 and has been around for years. It is a very good printer for the price. It is the most online community supported printer by far. It has a 220mm by 220mm build plate and can print  230mm high. It has a PTFE tube that runs from the extruder to the print head, this is called a Bowden style extruder.
        Kingroon KP3S:
        The Kingroon KP3S is also around $200 and has been around for years. It is an excellent printer for the price. Kingroon offers good support and it has a community online. It has a 180mm by 180mm build plate and can print 180mm high. It has a direct drive extruder that is connected to the print head.
